This is not a serious project. You should not use this. This is just some
ruby abuse. It even got the Evil of the Day Awardâ„¢ from zenspider.

This is mainly playing with ruby.
It currently gives you two methdi: chain_method, wich is something like an
alias_method_chain replacement using inheritance.

Example:

  class Foo

    def foo
     10
    end

    chain_method :foo do
      super + 3
    end

  end

This will create a module, move the old foo from Foo to the module, include
the module in Foo and  overwrite foo.

There also is auto_chain, which is rather a proof of concept:

  class Foo
    auto_chain do

      def foo
        10
      end

      def foo
        super + 1
      end

      def foo
        super ** 2
      end

    end
  end

  puts Foo.new.foo # => 121
