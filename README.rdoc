<b>A word of warning:</b>

This is heavy ruby abuse. It even got the Evil of the Day Awardâ„¢ from zenspider.

== What it does
Chainable is an alternative to alias_method_chain, that uses inheritance, rather
than aliasing. It does the following when "chaining" a method:

- copy the original method to a new model
- include the model
- overwrite the method

Thus you can use super and keep your method list clean, too!
It even supports a (rather dangerous) auto chaining mode, so you do not have
to explicitly chain a method, but chain a method whenever it would be
overwritten intead.


Example:

  class Foo

    def foo
     10
    end

    # now chain to foo
    chain_method :foo do
      super + 3
    end

    # or turn on auto chaining
    auto_chain do

      def bar
        10
      end

      def bar
        super + 1
      end

      def bar
        super ** 2
      end

    end
  end

  f = Foo.new
  puts f.foo # => 13
  puts f.bar # => 121

Of course you can do this with any class (or module):

  Array.class_eval do
    chain_method :each
    def each
      return super if block_given? or RUBY_VERSION >= "1.8.7"
      MyStuff::Enumerator.new self, :each
    end
  end
